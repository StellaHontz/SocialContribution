# SocialContribution
This repository contains the source code for the "Social Contribution" Application , an application developed for my thesis in computer sciene,at the University of Piraeus

It's an Android Application, developed in Java, that aims to manage acts of social contribution. 
With the help of Google Maps, the user is able to see what points of interest are registered and can browse them in list view too.
The user has also the ability to check the latest points, the most popular ones, what is around him or near his desired address and take a look at some suggestions, if he is registered. Furthermore, the points are categorized into three categories, "Animals","People" and "Events", which contain four subcategories each. Finally, the user, if registered, can have a favourites list, access his profile and check some personalized lists of points.

Google's Firebase products have been used, like Realtime Database,as a remote database, Firebase Storage, to store the photos of userlogos and points and Authentication ,for easy and secure sign in and sign up process.
